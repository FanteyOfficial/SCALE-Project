# BOSSES Mechanics
**The Great Fish**(very creative I know):
- he jumps just like a fish out of water would(1st phase);
- he summons TheToothBrush which the player as to climb to reach the fish(2nd phase);
- Location: MOUTH;

**The Dragon Ache**(I'll find a better name, I promise):
- he flies and he drops either fire or poop;
- after enough damage he falls down and the player has to reach the dragon to deal a final blow
- Location: STOMACH;

**FABBRIZZIO**(idk):
- geppetto who has a whale as weapon(don't ask me how he ended up there);
- that's it;
- Location: INTESTIN;
